# Top of work

## A thought on "getting ahead"
There will always be "more" to do, so you can't get ahead in that sense. Instead, "ahead" should be:
    
    "If I am brutally honest, can I answer yes to the following: Am I doing and/or living up to all below consistently? For at least a month?"

If yes, then you are ahead.

## Definition & Implementation
1. Effecient workflow
    ***How do I ensure this gets done?***: _???_
    _Is my current workflow effecient? Where and how can I improve it?_
    > Common task scripts
    > Tools (dev tools, extensions, etc.) usage
2. Quality code
    ***How do I ensure this gets done?***: _???_
    _Do I consistently add most or all below to my code?_
    > Tests
    > Error handling (+ warnings)
    > Refactoring
    > Concepts: Fluent, Immutable, Composable, etc.
3. Proper working conditions
    ***How do I ensure this gets done?***: _???_
    _Can I say yes to all below?_
    > Remote work
    > Goood pay
    > A say in tools and approach
4. Continous improvement
    ***How do I ensure this gets done?***: _???_
    _Am I engaging in below activities on a weekly basis? Can I prove it with examples?_
    > Courses
    > Code challenges
    > Open source (attend/read)
    > New tech
    > Test programming paradigms and patterns
    > Collection of public available examples
5. Happy peers and company
    ***How do I ensure this gets done?***: _???_
    _Do I seek feedback from my peers frequently? Do I use their advice?_
    > Interview people
6. Backlog empty
    ***How do I ensure this gets done?***: _I have a list besides my normal work tasks where I mix backlog and AOW tasks, and do those with either over-work or normal-work time, depending on the situation._
    _Do I attempt at emptying it on a weekly basis?_
    > Bugs fixed.
    > Tickets closed.
    > Misc done.
7. Ahead of work
    ***How do I ensure this gets done?***:  _I have a list besides my normal work tasks where I mix backlog and AOW tasks, and do those with either over-work or normal-work time, depending on the situation._
    > Misc (easy to delay tickets) are tackled before than later
    > 24h earned flex time (overwork)
    > Proactive action to reduce time wasters
    > Implementing niceness (tests, immutability, refactoring, proper architecture/modularity) instead of chasing fires (debugging, sphagetti code)
