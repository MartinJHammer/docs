## Coding advice: The list
- If it can be isolated, do it. Saves time, more testable.

- Refactor today, save 20x the time tomorrow. Avoid tech debt! Things are faster to do while fresh in memory.

- Even if "pretty, readable, maintable, etc. code" is YAGNI today, they teach good habits and will save time in the future. You _always_ need good code.

- Common modules are bad. Only import what you need, or the smallest possible piece of code.

- ALWAYS do sanity checks first. Test in sandbox env. Test assumptions. Log everything. Write tests

- Master your project & environemtn. Language(s), Framwork(s), Database(s), Business logic, Architecture, How to seed, mock, deploy, etc.

- Programming is COMMUNICATION! Talk with other devs/PMs before using their code: How does it work? What data do they give? Expect? Where in the UI does things happen? What is the definition of done? How do you create test data?

- Use available tools; Chrome debugger, VS code extensions, scripts to ease workflow, etc. etc.

- Start programming in source first, then write tests (understand what you actually want) that fails, implement, and then make tests pass.

- Immutability matters. A lot.

- Beware inheritance; it can be good, but should be used with caution. Prefer composition if possible.

- PROPER ERROR HANDLING! DO IT! Bad error handling is extremely frustrating for everyone. Also add as many warnings as possible.

- Talk with QA testers. Let them teach you how they manually test things - then write Cypress tests for them.
